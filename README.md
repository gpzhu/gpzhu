# Hi there,

Welcom to my personal Github website!!!
This is Gengping Zhu from Washington State University, i am using this site to share my data and script. 
Over the course of my scientific career, I have used spatial analysis and quantitative methods to mitigate the impacts of biological invasion and climate change. Specifically, I use species distribution models (SDMs) to predict species and biodiversity distributions following climate change and species invasions. These predictions are forwarded to policy makers or field managers to improve biodiversity conservation or management of invasive species under climate change. I have a entomology/biology background but feel particular interest in the geographical distribution of invasive species and biodiversity.
